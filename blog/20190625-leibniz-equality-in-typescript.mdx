In this post I’ll explain how you can use Leibniz equality to safely type your higher-order components in React, although it can be used in many other places (outside the React ecosystem) too.
Introduction

At the client I’m currently working for we use a lot of different charts to visualize processes over time. We have line charts, Gantt charts, you name it. Each of those charts features buttons which allows users to zoom in or out.

I’d like to use a simplified version of one of those graphs to explain what Leibniz, a German mathematician who lived well over 300 years ago, has to do with TypeScript.
